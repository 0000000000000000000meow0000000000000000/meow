# CORS proxy

A CORS proxy used to bypass the CORS policy within the [movie-web](https://movie-web.app) app.

## Deployment

Because [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) allows users to servers on multiple runtimes, we have provided a few buttons to help you deploy this example to your favorite provider. However, [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) remain the recommended option because of their large IP range and generous free tier.

For more information on how to deploy this example to your provider of choice, please refer to the [Nitro documentation](https://nitro.unjs.io/docs/deployment).
